I coded this site for two reasons:
1. I wanted to code my own site from the ground up and learn by project the full L-A-M-P stack.
2. I wanted to integrate into the site all company workflow from presenting products to the customer all the way through tasking and accounting.

I made a good start, but I decided in the end to set up a quick WordPress site and get on with business.
